# Image-Processing
A few coding examples that illustrate concepts in Image Processing (i.e. scaling, rotation, grayscaling).


The scaling and grayscaling tasks were completed using C#, while the remainder of the tasks were implemented using Python.
The largest of the tasks involved marking MCQ papers using OpenCV.

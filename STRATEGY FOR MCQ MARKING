Essentially this program functions by locating the top left hand corner of the MCQ sheet. 

The program then cuts out each block of answers with the knowledge that the first block is a 
certain distance from the top left corner of the page. 

Once the first block of answers has been isolated, the program traverses through each row 
of this block, and template matches the row against a set of templates (each representing
a specific possible answer; A, B, C, D, E, Empty Answer, and Invalid Input).

Once the first block of answers has been evaluated, the program moves the Region of Interest
down +-300 pixels to determine the starting point of the second block of answers, and repeats 
the process mentioned above.

The program then isolates the next column of answer blocks by moving the ROI back in line with
the first block, and across by +-500 pixels. And repeats the steps mentioned above for the
remaining six answer blocks. 

Some error checking was also included to recognize whether the particular answer sheet contained
valid answers.

Importantly, after each answer had been evaluated, the results were recorded in a simple .csv file
to indicate the answers of the particular MCQ.
